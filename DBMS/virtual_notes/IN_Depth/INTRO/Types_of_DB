## 🗂️ Types of Databases

There are **different types of databases**, each designed to solve specific problems.  
Let’s go through the most common ones used in the industry.

---

## 🧱 1. Relational Databases (SQL Databases)

This is the **most famous and widely used** type of database.

### 🔹 Key Characteristics
- Data is stored in **tables**
- Tables consist of:
  - **Rows** (records)
  - **Columns** (attributes)
- Tables are connected using **relationships**

➡️ Because of these relationships, they are called **relational databases**.

### 🧠 Real-World Analogy
Think of it like **spreadsheets**, but:
- Much more powerful
- Highly structured
- Designed for large-scale systems

📌 When people say *“database”*, they usually mean a **relational database**.

### 🧪 Examples
- :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
- :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
- :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

---

## 🔑 2. Key-Value Databases

In this type of database, data is stored as **key–value pairs**.

### 🔹 Structure
- **Key** → Unique identifier
- **Value** → Associated data

### 🧠 Analogy
Think of a **dictionary**:
- Word → Key
- Definition → Value

### 🧪 Examples
- :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
- :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

---

## 🧮 3. Column-Based Databases

Instead of grouping data by **rows**, these databases group data by **columns**.

### 🔹 Why Column-Based?
- Optimized for:
  - Searching
  - Analytics
  - Large-scale data processing
- Excellent for **huge datasets**

📌 Mainly used in **data warehousing and analytics**.

### 🧪 Examples
- :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
- :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

---

## 🕸️ 4. Graph Databases

Graph databases focus on **relationships between data points**.

### 🔹 Core Concepts
- Nodes (objects)
- Edges (relationships)
- Relationships are the **main priority**

📌 Best used when connections matter more than raw data.

### 🧪 Example
- :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

---

## 📄 5. Document Databases

Data is stored as **entire documents**.

### 🔹 Key Features
- Schema is flexible
- Structure is less important
- Focus is on storing complete objects in one document

📌 Best for:
- Semi-structured data
- Rapid development
- JSON-like data formats

### 🧪 Example
- :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

---

## 🧠 SQL vs NoSQL Databases

We can group databases into two main categories:

### ✅ SQL Databases
- Relational databases
- Structured schema
- Use **SQL** language

### ❌ NoSQL Databases
Includes:
- Key-Value
- Column-Based
- Graph
- Document databases

➡️ These databases **do not rely on traditional SQL** and are optimized for flexibility and scalability.

## 🎯 Course Focus

For this course:
- We will focus on **SQL Relational Databases**
- Because they are:
  - The most widely used in companies
  - Fundamental for data roles

📌 Primary focus:
- **:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}**

## ✅ Final Summary

| Database Type | Focus |
|--------------|------|
| Relational (SQL) | Structured data & relationships |
| Key-Value | Fast lookups |
| Column-Based | Analytics & big data |
| Graph | Relationships |
| Document | Flexible schemas |

Understanding these database types helps you **choose the right tool for the right problem**.
